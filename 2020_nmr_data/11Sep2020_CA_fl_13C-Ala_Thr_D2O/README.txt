These experiments were done after taking CA fl with 13C Ala and 13C Thr
labels, and transfering them to 100% D2O buffer from H2O.
This was in an effort to get better water supression and overall S/N.
Since there is no amide exchange in a fully deuterated sample, HSQCs were
not possible. 

CT-HSQC and HMQC data were obtained for both 13C Ala and 13C Thr samples.
Carried out on NMR 700.

Conditions:
25mM NaPi, pH 6.5*, 0.02% NaN3, 1mM DTT/TCEP

*could be altered from replacing sample in D2O, pD is ~0.4 higher then pH 
*did not double check this
