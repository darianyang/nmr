These experiments were done after taking CA fl with 13C Ala and 13C Thr
labels, and transfering them to 100% D2O buffer from H2O.
This was in an effort to get better water supression and overall S/N.

SOFAST-HMQC spectra were used, as this gave better s/n

sfHMQC data were obtained for both 13C Ala CA 20.2uM on NMR 600-1

Conditions:
25mM NaPi, pH 6.5, 0.02% NaN3, 1mM DTT/TCEP
